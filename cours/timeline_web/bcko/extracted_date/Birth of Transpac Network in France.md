On December 14, 1978, France Telecom creates the company Transpac, a subsidiary with private equity participation, responsible for operating the Transpac network, the first commercial packet data transmission network in France.

Transpac will grow very fast, thanks that they had the monopoly X25 in France, was used to support all the architecture of the Minitel system and the huge volumes of traffic induced by the electronic directory and services 3615 for the public rand.

Transpac was also used extensively in the professional and banking world for ATMs and payment terminals, with the ETEBAC protocol - Telematics Bank-Client Exchange.

Transpac allowed the connection of various equipment and terminals, at speeds that are found ridiculous today: the Minitel connected, via the switched telephone network, to 1200 bits / second of downstream flow and 300 bits / second of flow rate .

The Minitel servers were able to handle several hundred simultaneous connections on a single Transpac connection with a bit rate of 256 kbps! And if each of these connections involved a Minitel 3615 service billed 1.29 francs / min, then a Transpac line of 128 simultaneous access could produce a turnover of up to 1.29 x 60 x 24 x 128 = more than 200,000 francs per day!

The Minitel system was stopped in 2012, when Orange ceased marketing the Transpac network, gradually supplanted by the IP protocol. X25 has nevertheless continued to be used, with an infinitely less traffic volume, for other uses.
