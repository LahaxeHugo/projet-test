The software was withdrawn in 2001, after 2 years of legal proceedings in the United States for violation of copyright law.
Napster's role in the transfer of musical selections and the efficiency of the service raised the ire of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which very quickly, on December 7, 1999, filed a lawsuit against the popular service. The lawsuit which aimed to counter Napster did nothing but offer him a gigantic free publicity (Streisand effect). Media coverage of the lawsuit has inflated Napster's customer base with millions of new users.
The plaintiffs alleged that Napster facilitated copyright infringement, and filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to immediately stop the exchange of the musical selections.
Judge Marilyn Hall Patel of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California granted the preliminary injunction on the ground that the complainants have demonstrated a reasonable probability of success.
