Born at the beginning of 1999 in the lap of NTI, a company specialized in particular in the implementation of video servers, NetCine, a video on demand platform, has just completed version 2.0 of its platform. A technological migration which is accompanied - or rather which accompanies - a change of model since NetCine no longer seeks today to assert its brand but above all to market its technology in white label. The technology platform has therefore been revisited to serve this new model. For example to associate with user profiles a catalog and content that corresponds to the universe of each of NetCine's clients. "We actually offer an integrated video club service," says LoÃ¯c Ader, general manager of the company. To understand the meaning of the word "integrated", a visit to the technical backstage is essential.
