n May 2015, the SEO world was panicking because many webmasters noticed significant changes in the SERPs.

However, when members of the Google team, in charge of the quality of search engines, had been arrested on Twitter (as is very often the case), they replied that they had no stake to announce.

The webmasters, convinced that something was happening, decided to name this update Phantom, due to the lack of response from Google but obvious signs of change.

A few weeks later, Google confirmed that an update was actually deployed and that it concerned the quality of the content of the websites. The Phantom update was renamed Quality by Google. However, Google never wanted to say how this update was different from the Panda algorithm.

This algorithm aims to improve the quality of content by punishing sites with low deep content.

Periodically, updates are noticed by SEO experts but denied by Google. There are therefore several versions of the Phantom algorithm, named for lack of a better name, by Phantom 1, 2 or 3. However, their importance, mechanism and scope remain more or less unknown.
