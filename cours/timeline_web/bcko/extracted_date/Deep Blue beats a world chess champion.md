Deep Blue is a supercomputer specialized in the game of chess by adding specific circuits, developed by IBM in the early 1990s.

Losing a match in 1996 (2-4) against the world chess champion of the time Garry Kasparov, Deep Blue (then nicknamed Deeper Blue) defeated the world champion (3,5â€“2,5) during the match revenge in 1997, but outside the conditions required at the world championships.
