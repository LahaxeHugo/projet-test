The Domain Name System (DNS) establishes the familiar .edu, .gov, .com, .mil, .org, .net, and .int system for naming websites.

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a robust and scalable trading system compared to the TCP/IP.

The principle was to allow dynamic exchange of information associated with IP addresses, through a notification system accessible from all machines in the network.

Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. 

By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet.
