[Deezer.com](http://deezer.com/) was officially born on August 22, 2007, a company co-founded by Daniel Marhely, 22, and Jonathan Benassaya, student at ESSEC. Deezer, an online music streaming platform, born from the ashes of another site: [Blogmusik.net](http://blogmusik.net/) closed voluntarily in April 2007 under pressure from SACEM, SDRM, Sesam and SPPF. The reason: copyright infringement.

Officially closed, the now renamed site [Deezer.com](http://deezer.com/) announces that it has negotiated an agreement with the copyright societies. â€œIn a context where most internet users consume music in a free but illegal manner and against which professionals and artists legitimately wage an endless fight, [Deezer.com](http://deezer.com/) announces the long-awaited revolution. Thanks to the agreements negotiated with SACEM, [Deezer.com](http://deezer.com/) is now the only player to offer a free solution for Internet users while paying the players in musical creation (artists, authors, composers, record companies, ... ) via the advertising revenue generated. Â»Explain Daniel Marhely and Jonathan BENASSAYA, creators of this service, launched in June 2006 and already available in 16 languages.
