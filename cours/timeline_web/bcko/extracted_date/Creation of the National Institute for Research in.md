After a year of talks and after lengthy parliamentary debates, the Computer and Automated Research Institute (I.R.I.A.) project was adopted by the National Assembly in December 1966. It was officially created on January 3, 1967.

To install this crucial research, so new and so dependent on the industrial world, it is decided that the Institute, dedicated to the science of software, must itself be of a fairly new kind.

With few financial means and without any computer, the handful of researchers installed on the former NATO headquarters in Rocquencourt built the very special model of the Institute: small teams, agile, gathered around a scientific leader to complete a project evaluated every four years. The scientific (medical informatics, bioinformatics) and industrial (defense, automotive, aeronautics) ambitions do not always overlap, the model draws its relevance from this friction. 

From its inception, IRIA has a dual requirement for scientific excellence and technology transfer. It also has a programmatic and strategic mission and a training mission through research. Since the 1970s, the range of research topics has been broad, from robotics to fault prevention, through pattern recognition and digital image processing. For example, the prefigurations of the global Internet are being studied at IRIA, within the Cyclades project. These first works are worth to the Institute its letters of nobility, its international reputation and ... its national status. IRIA thus became INRIA in 1979. At the mercy of scientific priorities and rapid changes in computing, research topics are diversifying and today cover the main fields of digital sciences. The territorial network has also followed as the Institute developed with the creation of centers in Sophia Antipolis in 1983, Nancy in 1986, Grenoble in 1992 and finally Bordeaux, Lille and Saclay in 2008. 

INRIA Today, there are 2,700 people and about 180 research teams. As in 1967, INRIA aims to put scientific excellence at the service of technology transfer and society.
