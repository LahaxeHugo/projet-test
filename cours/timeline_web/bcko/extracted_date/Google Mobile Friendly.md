On April 21, 2015, Google proceeded to deploy its Mobile friendly algorithm that favors referencing mobile-friendly websites.

This algorithm had an even greater impact than those of Penguin or Panda and it was even renamed "mobilegeddon" by some SEO experts: the Armageddon of mobile compatibility.

This algorithm was deployed in real time and page by page: a site could therefore maintain a good overall referencing, even if some of its pages were not adapted to the mobile format.

Since 2015, mobile compatibility is a priority for Google and a very important SEO factor. In fact, in November 2016, Google announced that it would launch its Mobile-first index in the course of 2017.

What is Mobile-first index? Until now, Google has been referencing websites according to their desktop version. But the behavior of users changes and they spend more time surfing the internet on a mobile than on a computer. Google has decided to consider the mobile version of a website, to the detriment of the desktop version to perform its SEO.
