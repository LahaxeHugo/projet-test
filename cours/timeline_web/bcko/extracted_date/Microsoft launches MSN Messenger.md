MSN Messenger was proprietary client software linked to a proprietary instant messaging service for Windows XP / Vista, game consoles and mobile phones, and produced by Microsoft between 1999 and 2013. Born in 1999, MSN Messenger became Windows Live Messenger in 2005.
On January 10, 2013, Microsoft announces that MSN will no longer be available from March 15, 2013. Microsoft has decided to focus on Skype, the Internet call software it bought in 2011 for $ 8.5 billion. .
MSN Messenger users are then invited to migrate to Skype, which will automatically retrieve all their contacts and take over.
