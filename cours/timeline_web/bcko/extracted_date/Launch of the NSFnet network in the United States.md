Launch of the NSFnet network in the United States (The National Science Foundation Network), the backbone of the Internet with Arpanet (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network).

The National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET) was a program of coordinated, evolving projects sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NFS) to promote advanced research and education networking in the United States.
NSFNET was also the name given to several nationwide backbone computer networks that were constructed to support NSF's networking initiatives from 1985 to 1995. 
Initially created to link researchers to the nation's NSF-funded supercomputing centers, through further public funding and private industry partnerships it developed into a major part of the Internet backbone.

The National Science Foundation permitted only government agencies and universities to use the network until 1989 when the first commercial Internet service provider emerged. By 1991, the NSF removed restrictions on access and the commercial ISP business grew rapidly.
