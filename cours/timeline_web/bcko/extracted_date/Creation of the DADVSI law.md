The law relating to copyright and related rights in the information society, known as the DADVSI law, is a French law resulting from the transposition into French law of European Directive 2001/29 / EC on the harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society.

It transposes the European directive of 22 May 2001 and adapts copyright legislation to the development of digital techniques. It also expands the legal deposit to Internet sites in order to archive the Web. In particular, incarcerates 3 years in prison any person publishing a software allowing the putting on line of protected works without authorization.

This text was adopted by the National Assembly and the Senate on June 30, 2006, before being examined by the Constitutional Council which removed certain provisions. The text, published in the Official Journal of August 3, 2006, provides for amendments in the amount of 300,000 euros as well as 3 years in prison for anyone editing manifest software intended for making available to the unauthorized public works or protected objects, and up to 6 months in prison and a fine of 30,000 euros for anyone distributing or facilitating the distribution of software enabling them to break technical protection measures (DRM, for Digital Rights Management) which its defenders aim to prevent counterfeiting. The ‚Äúglobal license‚Äù project, planned for December 2005, was not retained (but remains on the program of several political parties), and the right to private copying limited by DRM devices. The law is officially applicable in France, certain provisions to be specified by the implementing decrees.

This law was followed on the same subject by the Olivennes report and the Hadopi bill.

These various texts also govern the field of application of private copying, that is to say the right to any user to copy, record, duplicate and save for strictly personal use, works or documents to which it has legal access (excluding counterfeit media, broadcasts or files).
