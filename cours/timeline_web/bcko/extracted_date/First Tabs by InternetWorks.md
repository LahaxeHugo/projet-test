In 1994, BookLink Technologies released the InternetWorks web browser. InternetWorksâ€™ most prominent feature was a tabbed GUI where tabs were laid out across the bottom of the browser pane and new browsing instances were kept within the same application window.

This interface has been copied by a lot of other browsers like Internet Explorer add-on shell named NetCapter and also IBrowse web browser in the late 90s, but it really became popular thanks to Opera and Mozilla Firefox in the early 2000s by adopting this interface style.

This new technology allows people to have one window open with 25 tabs instead of having 25 windows opened. This feature also adds in some plug-ins, games, extensions and bookmark folders.
