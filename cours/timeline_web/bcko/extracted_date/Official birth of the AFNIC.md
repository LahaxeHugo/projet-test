The French Association for Internet Naming in Cooperation (AFNIC) was born in 1997, under the law of 1 July 1901 on non-profit associations.

The AFNIC is the registry office designated by the State for the management of .fr domain names. Afnic also manages the ultramarine extensions .re (RÃ©union Island), .pm (Saint-Pierre and Miquelon), .tf (French Southern and Antarctic Lands), .wf (Wallis and Futuna) and .yt (Mayotte).

In addition to managing the French extensions of the Internet, AFNIC's role is part of a wider public interest mission, which is to contribute on a daily basis, thanks to the efforts of its teams and its members, to a secure and stable internet, open to innovation and where the French Internet community plays a leading role. 

Thus, AFNIC, a non-profit organization, donates 90% of its profits to its Foundation for Digital Solidarity. AFNIC is also the technical registry operator of companies and communities that have chosen to have their own extension, such as .paris, .bzh, .alsace, .corsica, .mma, .ovh, .leclerc or .sncf
