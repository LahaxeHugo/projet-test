Deployed in October 2013, it allows to display in the search engine results on the content of mobile applications, following its indexing. The user will be redirected to the application and not to the website.

Google has difficulty in judging whether the content of the App deserves to be better positioned than a competitor's web page.

It relies on the ranking of the dedicated web page to decide whether its relevance deserves the application to be proposed to the results instead of web page which highlights it.

Even if the new APP indexing is an advance, SEO mobile applications is less about the optimization of the App itself than about the optimization of the web version of the content and the presence of the link to the App.

It's not hard to imagine that Google will allow developers to present all content as well as metadata through the Indexing API. This will allow the positioning of app data independently of the website.
