At the heart of the huge nave is the campus start-up space. Station F promises nearly 3,000 workstations for around 1,000 young businesses. They will get their entry ticket to the campus from one of the 21 support programs developed by different partners.

Apart from these programs, French and international start-ups will also be able to use the old Halle Freyssinet as a Parisian base. For 900 euros per year and per person, these entrepreneurs can access the campus and its ecosystem for five days a month.

Station F wants to become the essential reference for start-ups in Paris. The gigantic campus intends to make itself visible by hosting numerous events related to the field of tech, in one of its 8 dedicated spaces, including an auditorium.

The start-up campus wants to do everything to keep its start-up companies alive. He promises to install games to allow start-upper workers to relax during their long days at work - we are waiting for the famous table football, essential in the offices of start-ups. Showers will also be available if the play sessions prove to be too intense.
