The first Arpanet link was established between the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Stanford Research Institute at 22:30 hours.

The message text was meant to be the word “login,” but only the L and O were transmitted before the system crashed. About an hour after the crash, the system was recovered and a full “login” message was sent as the second transmission.

The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was an early packet-switching network and the first network to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet. It marked the start of a new era.
