The Panda algorithm is a search filter. Introduced for the first time in February 2011, it penalizes the referencing of websites whose content is of low quality. Panda essentially aims to fight against content sites, created solely for SEO and spam.

The Panda algorithm is updated regularly to allow previously penalized sites to recover their SEO after improving the quality of their content, or on the contrary, to penalize sites that no longer comply with Google's guidelines.

In its first deployment, Panda had a major impact on the configuration of search results by altering 12% of SERPs in the United States!

After the 4.2 update, the quality of the content became a factor of SEO and the integration of Panda to the main algorithm of Google was confirmed in January 2016. Google now no longer announces the updates of Panda : This algorithm is constantly taken into account to define the ranking of a website in the pages of search results.
