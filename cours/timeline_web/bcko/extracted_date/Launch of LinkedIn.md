LinkedIn, business-oriented social networking Web site founded in 2002 and headquartered in Mountain View, California. Venture capitalist Reid Hoffman, product designer Allen Blue, marketing professional Konstantin Guericke, engineer Eric Ly, and engineer Jean-Luc Vaillant founded LinkedIn, and the Web site was launched in 2003.

Unlike other social networks such as Facebook and Myspace, which are often purely recreational, LinkedIn emphasizes a userâ€™s professional connections. Users create profile pages that have a structure similar to a rÃ©sumÃ©, in that users can summarize their career, advertise their particular skills, and list their education and employment history. Connections are formed between users when one accepts an invitation from another to join his or her network. LinkedIn allows users to further their careers by searching for jobs, finding connections (even at third hand) at a particular company, and receiving recommendations from other users. Membership is free; however, with payment for premium service, users can receive more profiles in their search results and see full profiles of any LinkedIn user.

By 2011 LinkedIn had more than 100 million members worldwide. In 2016 LinkedIn was acquired by Microsoft for approximately $ 26 billion. The following year it reported more than 500 million members in about 200 countries.
