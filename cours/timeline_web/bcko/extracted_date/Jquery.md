jQuery is a free, multiplatform JavaScript library created to facilitate client-side scripting in the HTML of web pages. The first version is launched in January 2006 by John Resig.
The purpose of this library is the path and the modification of the DOM (including the support of CSS selectors 1 to 3 and a basic support of XPath), it contains many features; including animations, handling cascading style sheets (accessibility of classes and attributes), event management, etc. The use of Ajax is facilitated and many plugins are present.
Since its creation in 2006 and especially because of the increasing complexity of Web interfaces, jQuery has been a huge success with web developers and its learning is now one of the fundamentals of training in Web technologies. It is currently the most used front-end library in the world (more than half of the online websites include jQuery).
However, its use becomes less relevant with the emergence of new libraries such as React (JavaScript) and Vue.js that replace it in the construction of Web Application Monopage.
