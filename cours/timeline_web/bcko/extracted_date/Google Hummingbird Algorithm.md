Hummingbird was deployed in September 2013. This algorithm is one of Google's most important: it has had a strong impact on how we do our research. Google chose to name this algorithm Hummingbird because thanks to him, the search became precise and fast.

Thanks to this algorithm, Google can understand a query or a sentence as a whole and no longer according to one or a few keywords. The proposed results are therefore of much better quality and the research could become more humane, thanks to the understanding of conversational research.

Since the implementation of this new algorithm, it is possible to obtain precise answers for queries of the type: "Which is the nearest bakery" or "Who is the doctor on duty today". This type of research was unthinkable before.

Thereby, would Hummingbird have opened the door to artificial intelligences and voice assistants like Alexa or Siri?
