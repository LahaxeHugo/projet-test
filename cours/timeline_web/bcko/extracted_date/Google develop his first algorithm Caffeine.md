Deployed in June 2010, Caffeine is a redesign of Google's indexing system. The Caffeine algorithm allows you to crawl and then index a page instantly.

Before the implementation of this algorithm, Google could not index a set of pages, after extracting, analyzing and understanding its contents.

With this new system that makes it quick and easy to index, Google is now able to provide 50% more content and articles in its search results than before the algorithm was implemented.
