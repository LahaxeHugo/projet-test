Git is a software for managing decentralized versions. This is free software created by Linus Torvalds, author of the Linux kernel, and distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2. In 2016, it is the most popular version management software that is used by more than twelve million people.

Similar to BitKeeper, Git does not stay on a centralized server, but uses a pair-to-pair connection system. The developed computer code is stored not only on the computer of each contributor to the project, but it can also be on the dedicated server. It is a low-level tool, which aims to be simple and efficient, whose main task is to manage the evolution of the content of a tree structure.

Git indexes files according to their checksum with the SHA-1 hash function. When a file is not changed, the checksum does not change and the file is only stored once. However, if the file is modified, both versions are stored on the disk.

From the start, Git was designed with the aim of operating in a decentralized manner, which is one of the keys to its success.
