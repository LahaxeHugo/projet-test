The Declaration of Cyberspace Independence is a document written on February 8, 1996 in Davos, Switzerland by John Perry Barlow, one of the founders of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. He supports the idea that no government (or any other form of power) can impose and appropriate the Internet, then in full expansion. It was written in part in response to the passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 in the United States.
"Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we gather." -John Perry Barlow, A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace
The Declaration sets out, in sixteen short paragraphs, the rejection of the appropriation of the Internet by an external government, in particular that of the United States. He claims that the United States has not had the "consent of the governed" to apply its laws on the Internet, and that the Internet is outside the borders of any country. He specifies that the Internet regulates itself, with its own codes and social languages, based on the ethics of reciprocity. It does so in language evocative of the Declaration of Independence of the United States, which is obvious in its last paragraphs. Although the document mentions the Telecommunications Act, it also accuses China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, and Italy of stifling the Internet1,2.
At the time of writing, Barlow had already written extensively on the Internet and its social and legal phenomena3. He is also one of the founding members of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. One of his best known works remains "The Economy of Ideas", then published in March 1994 in Wired magazine, he alluded to Thomas Jefferson and some of the ideas he would write in his statement.
Due to its purpose, Barlow's work quickly became famous and widely disseminated on the Internet. Within three months, approximately 5,000 sites had copies of the Declaration4. At nine months, this number has been estimated at 40,0005. To address Barlow's vision of an autonomous Internet, a virtual magistrate has been established by the Institute of Cyberspace Law, now hosted by "Chicago-Kent College of Law ". Courts would be appointed by the Institute and by other legal groups to resolve disputes online4. Outside of the Internet, responses will be less positive.
