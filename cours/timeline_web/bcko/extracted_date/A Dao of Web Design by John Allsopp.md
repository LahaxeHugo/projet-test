John specifically addresses the tension of this early era of Web design: traditional print designers sought to exert the same kind of absolute control over the display of webpages that they could over printed documents. John argues that this autocratic approach to design highlights a limitation of the medium:

“The control which designers know in the print medium, and often desire in the web medium, is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page. We should embrace the fact that the web doesn’t have the same constraints, and design for this flexibility.”

The Web is flexible by default; it always has been. In fact, the oldest known extant webpage is perfectly flexible. Or, as we’d call it today: responsive. We—designers, all of us—attempted to force the Web to play by the centuries-old rules and constraints of print media.
