Wi-Fi is a set of wireless communication protocols governed by IEEE 802.11 standards. A Wi-Fi network makes it possible to connect several computer devices (computer, router, smartphone, Internet modem, etc.) by radio waves within a computer network in order to allow the transmission of data between them.

Wi-Fi is a set of standards for wireless networks that was developed by the IEEE LAN / MAN Standards Committee Working Group 11. Its first standard is published in 1997, and allows exchanges at a theoretical speed of 2 Mbit / s. The protocol is being developed in 1999, with the publication of IEEE 802.11a and 802.11b standards, allowing 54 Mbit / s and 11 Mbit / s theoretical transfers, respectively.

The most important issue was to communicate the different Wi-Fi cards between them. In the early 2000s, telecommunications deregulation was in full swing and incumbent operators throughout Europe were taking their time to introduce these new radio technologies.

But everyone was aware that these technologies would be a lever for new uses and that more radio waves would be needed, but also that they would upset a well-established economic model.

Technology begins to invade everyday objects and the lifting of usage constraints in France in 2002 opens the way for operators to start offering Wi-Fi, on average, in hotspots. From 2004, this Wi-Fi market explodes literally, and the technology is not long in establishing itself as a means of access to the Internet from a mobile terminal.
