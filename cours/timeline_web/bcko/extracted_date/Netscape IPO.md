Before there was Baidu. Or Google. Before there was Theglobe.com or eBay, Webvan or Amazon. Before even Yahoo, there was Netscape.

In fact, when historians tell the tale of the dot-com boom, they will say it began on Aug. 9, 1995. That was the day shares of Netscape Communications Inc., maker of the first widely adopted Internet browsing software, more than doubled on their first day of public trading.

The stock offering's success showed that huge fortunes could be made by selling shares in a Web start-up, even though the company itself had yet to make a dollar of profit. Netscape co-founder Jim Clark's 20% stake in the company was worth more than half a billion dollars that day.

The IPO's success, which made millions for early Netscape investors, including not a few 20-somethings, was like a gunshot whose echoes reverberated from Silicon Valley to Wall Street.
