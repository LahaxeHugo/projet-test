Google Wave was a web-based messaging and collaborative work app created by Google that mixes e-mail, instant messaging, wiki and social networking with a spell checker and translator instant, and many other possibilities developed by third-party publishers.

The project was announced during the Google I / O conference of May 28, 2009. Google launched a first phase of alpha testing on September 30, 2009 with the distribution of 100,000 accounts to people who had registered on their site with the will to report bugs or develop extensions. Since May 18, 2010, the use of Google Wave was open to anyone with a Google Account.

Despite high expectations, Google Wave did not get the massive adoption expected and Google decided on August 4, 2010, not to continue the development of Wave as a standalone product. Nevertheless, the site was maintained in 2011 and early 2012 until the arrival of a replacement server and Google plans to use the technologies developed for Wave and integrate them into other Google products. Wave was open source under Apache license.
