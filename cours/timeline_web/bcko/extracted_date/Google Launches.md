Google is an American technology services company founded in 1998 in Silicon Valley, California, by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, creators of the Google search engine.

It has been a subsidiary of Alphabet since August 2015.

The company has mainly made itself known through the monopolistic situation of its search engine, historically competed by AltaVista and then by Yahoo! and Bing. She then made many acquisitions and developments and now owns many notable software and websites including YouTube, the operating system for Android mobile phones, as well as other services such as Gmail, Google Earth, Google Maps or Google Play.

Google's mission is to "organize information globally and make it universally accessible and useful." That said, the search engine also protects intellectual property by de-indexing sites that try to infringe copyright. After Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, its CEO has been, since 2015, Pichai Sundararajan.

Google has become one of the first American and global companies by its market valuation, a few years after an original IPO. In early 2008, it was worth $ 176 billion on Wall Street. On February 1, 2016, its market capitalization exceeded that of Apple and became the first in the United States, with a total of $ 550 billion dispersed in its various share categories.

In 2014, Interbrand's Best Global Brands ranking placed the Google brand in second position worldwide, behind the Apple brand, with an estimated value of $ 107.43 billion (+ 15% compared to 2013), exceeding the marks the hundred billion dollar mark for the first time since the creation of this ranking in 1974. In 2016, the Brand Z Top 100 ranking places Google in first position ahead of Apple.

The company has approximately 50,000 employees. Most of them work at the world headquarters: the Googleplex, in Mountain View, California.

Google is one of the largest companies on the Internet market and, along with Apple, Facebook and [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/), is part of the ‚ÄúBig Four‚Äù (the ‚Äúbig four‚Äù, also known as GAFA) of technology companies. In 2011, Google had a fleet of more than 900,000 servers, against 400,000 in 2006, making it the largest server fleet in the world (2% of the total number of machines), with devices distributed on 32 sites . At the same time, the search engine Google indexed more than 1,000 billion web pages in 2008. In October 2010, Google represented 6.4% of global Internet traffic and posted faster growth than the web. In Europe, Google would have a market share of 93% in search engines.

Observing gains in market share which translate into more consultations, Google is banking on infrastructure changes to improve its technical capacity. For example, the Caffeine infrastructure aims to increase the speed of processing web pages in order to index them more quickly (it would have gained 50% in speed).

Beyond the search engine, Google offers many software and services for free (email, office suite, video, photo, blog‚Ä¶) and is financed by advertising from the year 2000 with a principle of sponsored link in search results and "cost per click" billing for advertisers. However, the growing monopoly situation and questions of privacy are causing increasing concern, from the occasional Internet user to certain large organizations. Google has also been the subject of several lawsuits, notably for several copyright compatibility cases and for its Google Books platform.
