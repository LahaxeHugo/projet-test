Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is the most widely used software package for email and file protection. It was developed by Philip R. Zimmermann in the early 1990s and allows to encrypt and digitally sign email messages, individual files or protect complete file systems.

Zimmerman, by creating PGP, respond to privacy problems and wanted to fight against governments which used cryptography.

Indeed on 17 April, 1991, the New York Times reported that the following non-binding resolution had been added to Bill 266 in the US Senate to encourage industry to add trap-doors to their networking equipment, of course including Internet networking equipment:

"It is the sense of Congress that providers of electronic communications services and manufacturers of electronic communications service equipment shall insure that communications systems permit the Government to obtain the plain text contents of voice, data, and other communications when appropriately authorized by law."

Even though the bill was not passed, Zimmermann understood the resolution to mean that the US Government was one step away from introducing legislation outlawing secure communication systems for use by private citizens, thereby giving the state the ability to eavesdrop on any communications at any time. Indeed, legislation that made public key cryptography a form of protected munitions was introduced shortly thereafter, and then signed into law.

The right to privacy is spread implicitly throughout the Bill of Rights.

But with the coming of the information age, starting with the invention of the telephone, all that has changed. Now most of our conversations are conducted electronically. 

Thereby Zimmermann, working quickly to beat the legislation, invented the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) program based on the RSA public-key cryptography algorithm.
