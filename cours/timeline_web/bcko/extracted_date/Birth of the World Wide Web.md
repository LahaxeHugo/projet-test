Tim Berners-Lee, who was hired at CERN in Geneva in 1984 to work on data acquisition and processing, proposes to develop a web-based hypertext system to improve the dissemination of internal information: "Information Management: A Proposal ". He is the inventor of the first Web server he calls "httpd" and the first Web client he calls "WWW" for the World Wide Web.
