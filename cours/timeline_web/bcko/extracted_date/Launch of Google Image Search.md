Google Images is a service offered since 2001 by the Google search engine to allow to find on the web images related to a given subject.

The story goes that this service began to be developed when the classic search engine received many requests about the green Versace dress that singer Jennifer Lopez wore at the Grammy Awards in 2000.

The results page consists of a mosaic of images displayed in the form of thumbnails, with for each of them additional information: the size of the image, the weight and format of the file, the site from which it comes from, and an extract from the adjacent text, in which the keywords sought are highlighted.

Each of these thumbnails is a hypertext link to a page divided into two horizontal frames; the top one shows the thumbnail with the information that accompanied it on the previous page, and the bottom one contains the original page of the image, in order to appreciate it in context.

A new version was presented at a press conference on July 20, 2010. The images form a mosaic that fills the entire page available. When you move the mouse over an image, it gets bigger and the name of the site where it comes from appears. If you click on an image, you land on the publisher site, but unlike the old version, the top horizontal banner of Google giving information on the image is found in the right vertical and the site is grayed out with l image in the foreground which stands out from the site.

From 2013 in the United States (2017 in France), the Google Images interface is radically overhauled. The images always appear in the form of thumbnails but a click on a thumbnail opens a banner with a black background integrated into the results page (and no longer a new page). This banner presents: an enlarged version of the chosen image; the title of the page where it is located; website URL address; the native resolution of the image; an extract from the text of the page; "Consult", "Display image" and "Share" buttons; a selection of similar images.
