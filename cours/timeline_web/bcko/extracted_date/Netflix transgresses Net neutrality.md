Netflix signed an agreement with telecommunication operators Comcast and Verizon to guarantee faster access to the platform to their subscribers, against Net-Neutrality and payment of fees to internet service providers.

The network neutrality, is the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) must treat all Internet communications equally, and not discriminate or charge differently based on user, content, website, platform, application, type of equipment, source address, destination address, or method of communication.

In December 2017, the Federal commission of communications (FCC) voted the end of net neutrality in the United States.
