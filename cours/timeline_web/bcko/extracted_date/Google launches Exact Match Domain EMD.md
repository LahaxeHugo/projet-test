The Exact Match Domain algorithm was deployed in September 2012. It prevents low-quality sites from being referenced in the first search results, simply because their domain name matches a query that users are looking for.

Indeed, the domain name has a strong influence on SEO and some webmasters had found a parade to improve their SEO, creating domain names optimized to excess.
