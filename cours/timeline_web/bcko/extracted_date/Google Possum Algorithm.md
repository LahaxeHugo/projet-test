In update to Google Pigeon, the Possum search algorithm supports the latter in its task by favoring companies geolocated by Google and offering them better visibility in its search results.

Here are the 5 main points to remember about these positioning movements in SEO / local SEO:

- **Enlargement of the search area:**

    With Google Possum, this zone seems to have widened, giving more chances of visibility to companies located in the border zone

- **Filter and de-duplication of listings**

    Businesses in the same industry that share the same address will no longer be able to be displayed together in the localized result / local pack. Google Possum would now apply a filter to de-duplicate this type of results.

- **Impact of your real position**

    Your exact location would change the ranking of companies listed in the local Google Pack.

- **Choice of key words, order of words sought**

    The keyword entry order would become more important, the search will no longer return the same results systematically.

- **Positioning the local/map pack in SERP**

    The location of the map would no longer be only top of the SERP. Depending on the searches (brands, geolocalised searches, ...), the local Google pack could be in the middle of the results page.
