Dropbox is a service for storing and sharing copies of local files online offered by Dropbox, a company founded in 2007 by entrepreneurs Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi.

Drew Houston is said to have had the idea for Dropbox after repeatedly forgetting his USB drive while a student at MIT. According to him, at that time, existing services suffered from latency problems, bugs or were too complicated to use. He then begins to create the service for himself, before realizing that it could be useful to others.

Dropbox brings files together in one central place by creating a special folder on the user's computer. The contents of these folders are synchronized to Dropbox's servers and to other computers and devices where the user has installed Dropbox, keeping the same files up-to-date on all devices. Dropbox uses a freemium business model, where users are offered a free account with a set storage size, with paid subscriptions available that offer more capacity and additional features. Dropbox Basic users are given two gigabytes of free storage space. Dropbox Plus users are given two terabytes of storage space, as well as additional features, including advanced sharing controls, remote wipe, and an optional Extended Version History add-on. Dropbox offers computer apps for Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and Linux computers, and mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone smartphones and tablets.
