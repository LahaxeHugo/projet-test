Edward Snowden (security analyst for an NSA subcontractor) has leaked tens of thousands of NSA documents describing the US agency's massive surveillance program.
Documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras and Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald treated and divulged information directly contacted by Snowden:
• Snowden has described by the menu a number of programs for mass surveillance of telephone calls and online exchanges set up by the NSA.
• The US agency has allowed itself to eavesdrop on many foreign leaders. The last three French heads of state are concerned.
• Much data is collected on ordinary citizens in the United States.
• The NSA obviously does surveillance for anti-terrorist purposes, but also spies on economic and industrial espionage.
The shock was huge on the domestic front, with the NSA harvesting a huge amount of private data on grassroots citizens in its large nets. Barack Obama had to announce the re-evaluation of the programs by an expert group. The majority of these programs are still operational.
A gigantic diplomatic mess followed these revelations, as several US allies were publicly thrilled to be spied on. TAFTA negotiations with the EU have thus started under high tension.
Europe has discovered the technological gulf that separated it from its American ally in terms of monitoring technologies.
Persecuted and persecuted in the United States, Edward Snowden had to flee to Hong Kong, then to Moscow, where he has since been a refugee.
The Guardian and Washington Post's revelations of American surveillance programs, enabled by the Snowden affair, have been honored with a Pulitzer Prize.
