Bitcoin (₿, BTC) is a cryptocurrency otherwise known as crypto currency. In the case of the unit denomination, it is written "bitcoin" and, in the case of the peer-to-peer payment system it is written "Bitcoin". The idea was first presented in November 2008 by one person, or a group of people, under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. The source code of the reference implementation was published in 2009.
The G20 considers Bitcoin to be a “crypto-active”. This term “crypto-active” then refers to “virtual assets stored on an electronic medium allowing a community of users accepting them in payment to carry out transactions without having to resort to legal tender”.
