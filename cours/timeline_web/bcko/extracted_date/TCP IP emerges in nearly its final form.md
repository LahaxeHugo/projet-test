TCP/IP emerges in nearly its final form, as used for the first decades of the Internet, known as "IPv4".(48) which is described in IETF publication RFC 791.

Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol (IP).

It is one of the core protocols of standards-based internetworking methods in the Internet and other packet-switched networks. IPv4 was the first version deployed for production in the ARPANET in 1983. It still routes most Internet traffic today, despite the ongoing deployment of a successor protocol, IPv6.
