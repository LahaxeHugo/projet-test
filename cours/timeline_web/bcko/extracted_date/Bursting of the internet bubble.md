The 10th March of 2000 is an important date in the history of the internet. It marks the peak of the internet bubble. 

That day, the Nasdaq index of New York, which concentrates technology and internet stocks, caracole at 5.048 points. A record that would be followed by a fall in the markets of the "new economy". A decline of 27% during the first two weeks of April and 39.3% year on year. 

At the end of the year, the new information and communication technologies had lost their beauty and led to the Nasdaq plummet to 2,470.52 points.

The rush begins with the 1995 IPO of Netscape, the first browser. Investors bet frantically on the "new economy", which they compare to a new industrial revolution. 

Many of tech companies were doing good business, but investors have largely exaggerated the importance of the "very long run" in their estimates, and neglected to calculate that some of the companies were consuming their capital too fast to expect to reach the balance.

Under the pressure of the rise in long-term interest rates, the bubble ends up "bursting" from March 2000, in the form of a crash, extending to all scholarships and causing an economic recession in this sector and the economy in general.

The value of new companies is often overestimated and the system eventually burst in the form of a stock market crash.
