The Million Dollar Homepage is a website created in 2005 by Alex Tew, studying at Wiltshire England, to gain money to pay his degree studies.

The homepage contained 1 million pixels that were sold 1$ each as an advertising space. People had to by at least a square of 10x10 and then buyers had to place their images linked to a URL.

The goal was to sell every pixel so that Alex can collect 1 million $.

The website quickly became a true phenomenon and the last thousand of pixels were put on eBay on January 1st 2006 and sold 38 100$. The whole website was sold for 1 037 100$.
