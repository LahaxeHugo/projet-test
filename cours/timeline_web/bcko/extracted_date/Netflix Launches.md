Netflix is â€‹â€‹an American multinational company created in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph, operating in the creative industries sector through the distribution and exhibition of cinematographic and television works through a dedicated platform. Its head office is located in Los Gatos, California.

Initially, the company was only present in the commercial exploitation sector by providing an online rental and purchase service for DVDs delivered to your home, then offered to rent for a monthly subscription. Its subscription-based video-on-demand service began in 2007. Since then, the company has launched the distribution of a large number of films and television series, to which it is devoting increasing investments. .

In addition, Netflix is â€‹â€‹the subject of debates as to its legitimacy in this sector of activity, being from the technopole of Silicon Valley (Netflix is â€‹â€‹also part of the companies called "web giants") and not the historic birthplace of American cinema, the Hollywood district. In general, the company is participating in a change in the methods of consumption and production of audiovisual content which are increasingly geared towards delinearization. A pioneer in the subscription-based video-on-demand sector, Netflix faces competition in France and around the world from other film and television companies, but also from telecommunications and electronic commerce.
