Mozilla Firefox is a free and open source web browser, developed and distributed by the Mozilla Foundation with the help of thousands of volunteers using free / open source software development methods and free source code.
It has been managed since 2003 by the Mozilla foundation. This created in 2005 the company employing all the employees of the foundation, the Mozilla Corporation, and registered the Mozilla brand in 2006.
Firefox is originally a program derived from the Mozilla software (currently known as SeaMonkey), but taking only the navigation functions of it. This cross-platform software is compatible with various versions of Windows, macOS, GNU / Linux, Android and, at the end of 2015, iOS. It has been ported to other operating systems, which is made possible by the provision of its source code under the free MPL license.
The software is part of the list of free software recommended by the French State as part of the overall modernization of its information systems (S.I.).
This software was a growing success at first, exceeding 1.2 billion downloads in January 2010. Even if this figure does not reflect the actual number of users of the software, Firefox quickly became the main competitor of Internet Explorer , Microsoft's web browser. In December 2010, Firefox temporarily became the most used browser in Europe ahead of Internet Explorer and Google Chrome. According to a majority of studies carried out in Europe and worldwide, it is currently behind the Google Chrome browser. On April 3, 2013, the Mozilla project celebrates its fifteen years of existence.
