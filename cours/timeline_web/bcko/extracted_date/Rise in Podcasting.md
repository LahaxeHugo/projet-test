A podcast is an online video or audio, available on the Web. They are issued by several types of broadcasters and automatically received in a reader which combines the broadcasts. Thereafter, the listener can listen to them directly on this player, download them on his personal computer or transmit them on his portable music player.

Podcasting differs from radio and television broadcasting by the distribution of sound or image not by a centralized mechanism which would send a stream to its listeners, but by the action of the listeners who download the podcast files. The authors publish files and it is the listeners who have the role of managing a playlist with their different subscriptions. In other words, the audience chooses the authors and programs, and updates to new programs will be automatic in their aggregator.

Podcasting has its origins in the advent of Web 2.0 and particularly in the development of technology like RSS. In his article presenting Web 2.0, Tim O'Reilly points out the possibilities offered by RSS feeds: "RSS is no longer only used to display blog news, but also for all kinds of regularly updated data: stock price, weather, availability of photos ”. Even if O’Reilly is not yet talking about video, it presents itself as the logical evolution of content syndication.

In France, Arte Radio  is the first website to offer free podcasts on February 1st of 2004.
