Facebook was founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg and his Harvard college mates, Chris Hughes, Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum and Dustin Moskovitz. First reserved for students of this university, it then opened up to other American universities before becoming accessible to everyone in September 2006. The name of the site comes from the photo albums gathering the photos of the faces of all the students taken at the start of the academic year.

The third most visited website in the world after Google and YouTube according to Alexa, it crossed the number of 2 billion active users in June 2017. On August 24, 2015, for the first time, one billion people used Facebook on the same day.

Facebook is regularly the subject of political, legal, economic, cultural and social debates. Its influence in the public sphere and the way it affects the social life of its users, its use of personal data, its role in the spread of fake news, its responsibility in the trivialization of hate speech, its inaction with regard to content violating its own rules, or even its content regulation policy are often discussed in the news.
