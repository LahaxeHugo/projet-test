Google beat out a number of other YouTube suitors, including Microsoft, Viacom, Yahoo and the News Corporation. By successfully negotiating the deal, Google has once again proved that it is the Internet‚Äôs dominant player.

In 2005 the web was in desperate need of a video hub, and Google tried to create one with the poorly named Google Videos (a naming concept the company refuses to reinvent). But the site failed to catch on as quickly as YouTube, which had more social features and extremely popular pirated TV clips (try to find a 2006 feature about YouTube that doesn‚Äôt mention ‚ÄúLazy Sunday‚Äù). At the time of its acquisition, YouTube was one of the world‚Äôs fastest-growing websites, and its executives had a clear understanding of what users wanted out of a video site. As the adage goes: If you can‚Äôt beat them, buy them.

YouTube has evolved into the world‚Äôs biggest video search engine, with a sprawling database of clips made navigable by Google‚Äôs smart algorithms. Google can sell display and video ads against all these clips, to the tune of more than $5.2 billion in estimated revenue this year, according to eMarketer. It helps that search results from the main Google search engine are often filled with YouTube clips. Google loves when search queries drive people to other Google services, and YouTube is a big part of that strategy.

The heightened competition only makes YouTube a more important strategic asset for Google. In a world without YouTube (or with an independent but less powerful YouTube), Facebook might have been able to waltz into the video sector and take over, usurping Google as the leader in digital advertising. YouTube acts as a bulwark against younger tech companies that know Google could be toppled as internet use shifts from desktop to mobile and, soon, to living room devices. Every dollar YouTube makes is a dollar Facebook or Snapchat doesn‚Äôt.

Now a decade later, though, the YouTube buy is widely considered to be one of the best consumer tech acquisitions ever.
