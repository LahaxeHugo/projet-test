Hotmail is one of the very first services to offer free web-based e-mail in the world started back in 1996, founded bt Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith.

In 1996, the Web was still gaining traction. Almost all personal Internet access was over dial-up services such as AOL, MSN, CompuServe, and EarthLink. A lucky few had early "high-speed" Internet service over ISDN connections, but many companies hadn't even connected their corporate email systems to the Internet yet. While there were a few Web-based mail offerings from ISPs integrated into Web hosting accounts, and Lotus had demonstrated a Web interface to cc:Mail in 1994, Hotmail and competitor Rocketmail (which would later become Yahoo Mail) were the first to offer free, Web-based email funded by advertising. By 1997, Hotmail already had 9 million users.

Hotmail was acquired by Microsoft in 1997 for an estimated $400 million US$ and launched as MSN Hotmail and later rebranded as Windows Live Hotmail and now in 2013 as Outlook.

It success lies in the fact that hotmail was the first to offer safety innonvations like anti-virus scanning for attachments. They also integrated the calendar service, built in a reading pane, added rules, spell checking, search, web messenger and lots more for companies.

As of 2011, Hotmail had 360 millions million users per month. It was available in 36 different languages. In 2013, Hotmail replaced with Outlook.com which features Microsoft's Metro design language, and closely mimics the interface of Microsoft Outlook.

As per the transition of Hotmail to Outlook, existing Hotmail users have been forcibly upgraded to Outlook.com while retaining thei ["@hotmail.com](mailto:%22@hotmail.com)" email address, password, messages, folders, contacts, rules, vacation replies.
