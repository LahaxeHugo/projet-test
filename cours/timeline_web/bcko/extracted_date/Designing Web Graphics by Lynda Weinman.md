After looking for an introductory book for a design class she was teaching and finding none, Lynda Weinman decided to publish the massively successfulÂ *Designing Web Graphics*.
The book grounds itself in a discussion of web graphics as a way of properly introducing the capabilities and potential of web design.

As a business owner, computer instructor and author, she also founded an online software training website [lynda.com](http://lynda.com) with her husband, website that has been acquired by LinkedIn in April 2015 for 1.5 billion $ and that became LinkedIn Learning.
