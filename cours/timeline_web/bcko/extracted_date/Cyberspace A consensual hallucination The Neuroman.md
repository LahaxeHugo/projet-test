In Neuromancer, published 30 years ago this month, Gibson popularized the idea of â€‹â€‹cyberspace: a "consensual hallucination" created by millions of connected computers.

On its release, Neuromancer won the "big three" for science fiction: the Nebula, Philip K Dick and Hugo awards. It sold more than 6m copies and launched an entire aesthetic: cyberpunk. In predicting this future, Gibson can be said to have helped shape our conception of the internet.
