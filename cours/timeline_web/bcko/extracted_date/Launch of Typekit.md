Adobe Fonts was launched as Typekit in November 2009 by Small Batch, a company run by creators of the Google Analytics service. In October 2011, the service was acquired by Adobe. On 15 October 2018, Typekit changed its name to Adobe Fonts.

Typekit is an online service which offers a subscription library of high-quality fonts. The fonts may be used directly on websites or synced via Adobe Creative Cloud to applications on the subscriber's computers.

For web site use the service works with the @ font-face CSS property and JavaScript. Visitors to a web site who have disabled javascript in their browser will therefore not see the fonts.
