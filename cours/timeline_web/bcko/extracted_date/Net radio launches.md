Radio HK, founded by Norman Hajjar, was the first full-time, Internet-only radio station that began by broadcasting music from unsigned and independent bands. It's estimated the station reached 100,000 people in 46 countries and held a trial license from ASCAP, making it a pioneer for instigating the legitimate broadcasting of Internet music.
