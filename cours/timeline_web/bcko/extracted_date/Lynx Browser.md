Lynx is a text-based web browser, and therefore uses the keyboard as the main interface. The supported protocols are: Gopher, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, WAIS, and NNTP.
Navigating in Lynx consists of selecting the chosen link using the arrow keys, or alternatively having Lynx display a number corresponding to each link and typing the number of the chosen link. Current versions support SSL and many features of HTML, but JavaScript does not. The frames are identified by name and can be explored as if they were separate pages.
Lynx is a product of the Academic Computing Services of the University of Kansas and was originally developed in 1992 by Lou Montulli, Michael Grobe and Charles Rezac. Garret Blythe created DosLynk before also working on Lynx. Foteos Macrides ported much of Lynx to VMS and maintained it for a time. Since 1995, Lynx has been released under the GNU GPL license. It is now maintained by a group of volunteers.
Lynx was designed for Unix and VMS systems, and runs in particular on GNU / Linux. MS-DOS and Windows versions are also available. There is also a version called MacLynx for Macintosh "System 7 or higher" that is not updated regularly.
Thanks to its easy-to-integrate interface with a speech synthesizer, Lynx was very popular with the visually impaired, but the improvement in speech synthesis reduced its interest for the blind.
Lynx is still used as a web development tool since it allows you to consult a document in the same way as a web crawler would.
Its main counterparts are Links and w3m.
