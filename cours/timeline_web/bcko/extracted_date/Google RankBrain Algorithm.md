Rankbrain, launched in early 2015, is actually part of the Hummingbird search algorithm.

Rankbrain is rather particular and mysterious because it would be an artificial intelligence that would be able to understand the meaning of similar queries, but formulated differently.

For example, this artificial intelligence could understand over its learning, that the queries "Barrack" and "Mari Michelle Obama" should provide a similar answer that is "Barrack Obama."

In the extension of Hummingbird, Rankbrain aims to interpret and understand the most abstract searches of Internet users. Most importantly, Google has stated that Rankbrain was one of the three most important SEO factors (with quality of content and links).

Rankrain learning is applied to all searches, but it is done offline: Google feeds it with historical research files so that it learns to make predictions. These predictions are then tested and applied if they prove to be correct.
