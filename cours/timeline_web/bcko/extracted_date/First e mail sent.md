In 1965, the e-mail is introduced in the MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Then in 1971, Ray Tomlinson develops the ARPANET network (ancestor of the Internet), creates an e-mail address and sends his first e-mail on this network. Before, there was no way to send something to a specific person at a specific address.

Thanks to this event, a standard RFC 733 format is proposed to allow messages to be sent over the Internet. The US Postal Service is starting to see the email as a threat.

The first time someone used the word "e-mail" is in 1982 during the SMTP creation, a communication protocol used to transfer electronic messages and electronic mail servers.

Microsoft Mail for Mac has been launched in 1988, which popularize the concept towards the population.
