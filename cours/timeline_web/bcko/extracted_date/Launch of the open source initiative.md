Born in 1998 from a split in the free software community (community of users and developers) in order to conduct a policy deemed more suited to economic and technical realities, the open source movement defends the freedom of access to program sources they use, in order to achieve a software economy dependent on the sole sale of services and no longer that of user licenses.

Among the open source applications, on the account of his contribution to the development of the Linux kernel and software powered by this operating system. A series of essays by Eric S. Raymond, dating from 1998, testifies to how the open source was seen at the time as a kind of new Eldorado. Among these essays described The Cathedral and the Bazaar and The conquest of the noosphere1, which exposes the open source development mode.

In 2005, several thousand French computer scientists were employed thanks to this model2, both in small companies selling specialized services and in "large integrators" and user companies. In addition, giants in the sector (IBM, Novell, HP, etc.) combine some of their technical and commercial strategies on the open source approach.

The use of the terms free and open source software interchangeably is common in the media, user licenses are often the same and developers do not always care about the distinction.

A heated controversy opposes the supporters of open source and the supporters of free software.

The software that supports the free software movement meets the criteria set out by the Free Software Foundation in the Free Software Definition, itself written by Richard Stallman.

The concept of open source is also based on precise definitions. The use of the terms open source was suggested by Christine Peterson, of the Foresight Institute, in order to remove the semantic ambiguity of the English word free which means free in the sense of "freedom", but also free in the sense of "free access, free - and through this semantic correction, indicate to users that software has a cost.

The main criticism from the parent movement of free software is the fact that open source communicates almost exclusively only on one of the technical characteristics of software (freedom of access to the operation of software) by obscuring the primary motivations from which it came. , at the risk of losing them. They accuse open source of being driven by the dynamics and the financial resources and expertise of multinationals, opposing it to free software driven by philosophical and political ideals.
