[Match.com](http://match.com/) was founded by Gary Kremen and Peng T. Ong in 1993. Early on, Kremen was assisted by Ong, who helped in the design of the initial system, and Simon Glinsky, who served as the company's marketing consultant. Fran Maier joined the company as its director of marketing.

 According to a retrospective from The Atlantic, Maier helped to develop [Match.com](http://match.com/)'s initial business strategy, which included a subscription model and the inclusion of diverse communities, including women, technology professionals, and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender communities. [Match.com](http://match.com/) went live as a free beta in early 1995.
