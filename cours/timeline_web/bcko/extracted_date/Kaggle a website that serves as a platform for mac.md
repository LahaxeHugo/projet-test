Kaggle is a web platform organizing data science competitions. On this platform, companies offer problems in data science and offer a price to the datalogists obtaining the best performance. The company was created in 2010 by Anthony Goldbloom.
How Kaggle competitions work:
The competition leader prepares the data and a description of the problem. Kaggle offers an advisory service, supervises the competition and anonymizes the dataâ€¦
Participants experiment with different techniques and compete to produce the best model. In most competitions, observations are noted immediately (the score is based on their predictive value in relation to a hidden solution file) which gives a live ranking.
At the end of the competition, the presenter distributes the prize (money, job offer) in exchange for "a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty free license [...] to use the winning Entry", that is that is to say the right to use, free of charge and without time limit, the algorithm and the software developed, in a "non-exclusive way unless otherwise indicated".

In addition to its public competitions, the company also offers private competitions limited to the best participants in Kaggle and for university groups.
