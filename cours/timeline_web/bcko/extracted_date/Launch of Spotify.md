Spotify is a Swedish music streaming service in the form of proprietary software and a website. This digital distribution platform allows almost instant listening to music files.

Founded by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon, Spotify actually started as a small start-up in Stockholm, Sweden. They developed the platform in 2006 as a response to the growing piracy problem the music industry was facing.

Launching two years later, Spotify offered music fans a free service with advertising, in hopes they would upgrade to the Â£10 a month ad-free subscription.

Before streaming services came along you might have been guilty of using controversial file sharing sites like Napster, LimeWire and The Pirate Bay to download your music.

This cost the music industry millions each year because well - you're not paying for the songs.

"I realized that you can never legislate away from piracy. The only way to solve the problem was to create a service that was better than piracy and at the same time compensates the music industry." Daniel told The Telegraph in 2010.

Spotify works on a revenue sharing model with music rights holders. In September 2014, a title listened to per user brought in about â‚¬ 0.006 to its beneficiaries. This means that a million listeners would bring in â‚¬ 6,000, which is often considered derisory to offset the drop in revenue on physical media (still -13.6% in the first half of 2014), but this drop in physical sales is the same in countries where Spotify is not present. However, growth is rapid and allows reversible revaluations to be obtained each year and already reached 17% of recorded music revenues in the first quarter of 2014.

In 2016, the listening remuneration for rights holders fell to an average of $ 0.00384 (â‚¬ 0.00327) for artists without a contract and $ 0.00437 (â‚¬ 0.00372) for artists under contract with a record company. This trend seems to confirm at this stage that the more the streaming market develops, the less artists are paid. It should be noted that other competing streaming services pay artists more generously: twice as much at Apple Music, more than four times as much at Napster.

According to a study by ADAMI, for a monthly subscription paid 9.99 euros: 6.54 euros would be donated to intermediaries (70% to producers, 30% to the music platform), 1.99 euros for the State ( VAT), 1 euro for copyright, finally the artists listened to shared 0.46 euro.

The emergence of Spotify has revolutionized the music industry which is no longer based only on the number of albums sold, but also on the number viewed on this type of platform.
