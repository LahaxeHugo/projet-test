A peer-to-peer file sharing is a network that allows files to be shared between several computers connected to each other over the Internet, each user can be a server and receiver of another user. They thus form "peers".

The essential technical advantage of the system over a centralized load is that the more content a requester has on a central server, the more it is congested. On the contrary, the more it is on a peer-to-peer network, the greater the download speed from all these partial sources combined. This technology is called Segmented file transfer, it is nicknamed swarming downloads.

The increase of the rates, the continuous price decrease of the offerings of the access providers, the computers and the peripherals (multimedia, engraving, storage capacity on the rise) are the technological and commercial factors which allow the emergence in June 1999 of the first software used on a large scale: Napster. If it is initially created in another perspective (its creator, Shawn Fanning, an 18-year-old American student, wished he could easily exchange music with his friends), he quickly becomes dedicated to downloading media in MP3 format on Internet based on a centralized search engine for downloading files without going through this server5. In the first week, 15,000 people downloaded the software and 23 million in July 2000.

The ease of use of Napster (download / send / search for titles) and the fact that it is not reserved for specialists ensure its rapid success. The dramatic increase in the number of users causes such a huge increase in the number of songs available. As a result, "illegal" downloading is an integral part of the Internet phenomenon and peer-to-peer software is becoming fashionable new applications.
