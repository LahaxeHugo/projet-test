Lilo is a French search looking to take on giants like Google and Yahoo â€“ and it has grown to 700,000 users per month and a total number of searches of half a billion.

It invests 50% of its total revenue in social and environmental projects and has distributed â‚¬220,000 to 50 projects, including social enterprises, charitable organisations and co-ops.

Each time users search on Lilo they earn a symbolic drop of water, which represents the money gained from advertising linked to the web page. They are then asked to choose a project they want to support and the drop of water gets converted into money.
