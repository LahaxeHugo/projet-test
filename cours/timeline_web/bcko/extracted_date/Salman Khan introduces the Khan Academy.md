Khan Academy is a non-profit association founded in 2008 by Salman Khan. On the principle of "providing high quality education to everyone, everywhere", the website publishes online a free set of more than 2,200 mini-lessons, via video tutorials stored on YouTube, dealing with mathematics, computer science , history, finance, physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, music, pictorial art and economics.

In late 2004, Khan began serving as a math tutor for his cousin Nadia, using Yahoo's Doodle notebook. When other relatives and friends also wanted to access his little lessons, he decided that it would be more practical to distribute the tutorials on YouTube. Their popularity and the testimonies of students who appreciated them led Khan to quit his job in finance in 2009 and to devote himself to the Academy full time. Bill Gates said, "I would say we have moved about 160 IQ points from the hedge fund category to the" leveraged education "category. The day his wife allowed him to leave work was actually a great day. "

As of December 2009, Khan's tutorials hosted by YouTube received an average of 35,000 visits per day. Each video is approximately ten minutes long. The drawings are made with SmoothDraw; they are recorded and produced using video capture from Camtasia Studio. Khan wanted to avoid a format that would involve someone standing in front of a whiteboard, and instead wanted to present the content in a manner similar to sitting next to someone working on an issue on a piece of paper: "If you watch someone make a problem thinking out loud, I think people find it enriching and not too intimidating. ” Offline versions of the videos have been distributed by associations in rural areas in Asia, Latin America and Africa. Although the current content of the Khan Academy is mainly devoted to mathematics and physics, Khan says his long-term goal is to provide "tens of thousands of videos on almost any subject" and to create "the first free virtual school with global ambition ”.

The Khan Academy also provides an online exercise system that generates problems for students based on their skill and performance level. Khan believes his academy demonstrates the possibility of revisiting the traditional classroom paradigm, using software to create tests, mark them, highlight specific problems for some students, and encourage those who are most successful to help their comrades in difficulty.

Its small courses are relaxed, without technical frills. Khan's face never appears, Internet users only see his doodles and diagrams on an electronic board, produced step by step. The Khan Academy looks like a virtual school, but it makes the classroom, the campus, the administrative infrastructure and the figure of the teacher less central.
