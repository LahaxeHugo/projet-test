The law for confidence in the digital economy, n¬∞2004-575 of June 21, 2004, abbreviated under the acronym LCEN, is a French law on Internet law, transposing the European directive 2000/31 / CE of 8 June 2000 on electronic commerce and certain provisions of the directive of July 12, 2002 on the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector.

The essential contribution of the LCEN is that it poses a general Internet law: on the one hand, it defines communications on the Internet by creating new legal categories and, on the other hand, it establishes a regime of responsibility for its actors. We can also cite the adoption of the country of origin principle, the electronic advertising regime, the electronic commerce regime and the intervention of communities in electronic communications networks.

There have been many debates regarding the LCEN. Indeed Internet users were worried about seeing communications on the Internet qualified as audiovisual communications, which would be submitted to the Superior Audiovisual Council. Second, measures to combat online piracy caused a lot of internet users to react. Finally, the Constitutional Council rendered a decision censuring certain provisions of the LCEN relating to the prescription of press offenses, but affirming the position of the constitutional judge with regard to the need to transpose Community law.
