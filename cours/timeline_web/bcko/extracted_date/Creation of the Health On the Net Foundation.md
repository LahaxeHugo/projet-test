On September 7 and 8 1995, an international conference called The Use of The Internet and World-Wide Web for Telematics in Healthcare lead to the creation of HON. Health On the Net is a non for profit organisation in official relations with the World Health Organization (WHO), that promotes transparent and reliable health information online. It helps people to identify what are the most reliable websites in terms of medical informations.

The HONcode lists 8 rules websites need to follow to earn a certification :

1. Authority ‚Äì information and advice given only by medical professionals with credentials of author/s, or a clear statement if this is not the case
2. Complementarity ‚Äì information and help are to support, not replace, patient-healthcare professional relationships which is the desired means of contact
3. Confidentiality ‚Äì how the site treats personal and non-personal information of readers
4. Attribution ‚Äì references to source of information (URL if available) and when it was last updated
5. Justifiability ‚Äì any treatment, product or service must be supported by balanced, well-referenced scientific information
6. Transparency of authorship ‚Äì contact information, preferably including email addresses, of authors should be available
7. Transparency of sponsorship ‚Äì sources of funding for the site
8. Honesty in advertising and editorial policy ‚Äì details about advertising on the site and clear distinction between advertised and editorial material

But the HONcode only applies to a website‚Äôs editorial processes and details, not to the actual published contents. The term "certification" can be misleading to the general public, as it can imply that the contents of the website are trustworthy, reliable or otherwise independent.
