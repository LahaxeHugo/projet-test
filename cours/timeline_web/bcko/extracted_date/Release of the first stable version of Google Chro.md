Chrome is a proprietary web browser developed by Google based on the free Chromium project running on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS. Chromium is similar to Chrome, but the latter contains cookies (sending personal information to a Google server) or trackers.

It was announced on September 1, 2008, the day before the release of the first beta version. The first stable version was unveiled on December 11, 2008. According to the StatCounter institute, Google Chrome became the most used browser in the world in June 2012, with around a third of users.

Based on the observation that the time spent on the internet is constantly increasing, Google decided to create a browser that is fast, dynamic and innovative, in order to save time on the one hand, but also to be adapted to the content of the pages web that evolve and become more complex year after year. Indeed, Chrome does not want to be a simple browser, but a software intended to optimize the functioning of online services and, ultimately, to promote cloud computing.
