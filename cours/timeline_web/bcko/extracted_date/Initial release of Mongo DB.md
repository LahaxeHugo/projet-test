MongoDB has been developed since 2007, this company was then working on a cloud computing system, widely distributed data computing, similar to Google's Google App Engine service.

MongoDB is a document-oriented database management system that can be distributed to any number of computers and does not require a predefined data schema. It is written in C ++. The server and tools are distributed under the SSPL license, the drivers under the Apache license and the documentation under the Creative Commons4 license. It is part of the NoSQL movement.

MongoDB allows you to manipulate structured objects in BSON format (binary JSON), without a predetermined scheme. In other words, keys can be added at any time "on the fly", without reconfiguring the database.

The data takes the form of documents themselves stored in collections, a collection containing any number of documents. Collections are comparable to tables, and documents to records in relational databases. Unlike relational databases, the fields of a record are free and can be different from one record to another within the same collection. The only common and mandatory field is the main key field ("id"). Furthermore, MongoDB does not allow very complex standardized requests, nor JOINs, but allows programming specific requests in JavaScript.
