On January 18, 2012, a series of coordinated protests occurred against 2 proposed laws in the US Congress : the SOPA ( Stop Online Piracy Act) and the PIPA (Protect IP Act).

Protests were based on concerns that the bills, intended to provide more robust responses to¬†copyright infringement arising outside the United States, contained measures that could possibly infringe online freedom of speech, websites, and Internet communities. 

The move to a formal protest was initiated when some websites, like Reddit and Wikipeda considered temporarily closing their content and redirecting users to a message opposing the proposed legislation. Google, Mozilla and Flickr soon featured protests against the acts. 

Those 2 proposed laws finally got abandonned.
